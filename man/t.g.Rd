\usage{
\method{t}{g}(t, n1, r, sdpre, sdpost, dir, k = 1)

\method{t}{g}(t, n1, r, sdpre, sdpost, dir, k = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{the paired-sample/dependent t-statistics}

\item{n1}{group 1 sample size}

\item{r}{the correlation between the paired scores}

\item{sdpre}{the standard deviation of the pre-test scores}

\item{sdpost}{the standard deviation of the post-test scores}

\item{dir}{empirical direction: +1 or -1. articles sometimes report t-statistics in absolute value, may be prudent to check when extracting stats\cr
if the reported t-statistics is positive, read text to ensure it reflects a positive association, enter the t as is and enter dir = 1 if so\cr
if the reported t-statistics is positive, but text suggests a negative association, enter the t as is and enter dir = -1\cr
if the reported t-statistics is negative, you can simply enter the negative t-value and enter dir = 1\cr
note: if your t-statistics is computed from taking the ratio of b and se, e.g., using bse.t(), then it should already have empirical direction "built-in" since b is directional itself, so simply enter dir = 1}

\item{n2}{group 2 sample size}

\item{n}{number of participants}
}
